			We love science for the same reason millions play their favorite game everyday. Because it's fun. Our engineers experiment, compelled to push the limits of speed, precision, reliability and intuitiveness. We test buttons to 20 million clicks and design our own sensors so we don't have to accept the status quo. For over 30 years, the relentless pursuit of what's next has been our game and we've gotten pretty darn good at it. And we do it all for one reason: to give gamers the ability to seamlessly translate their thoughts into actions, taking their game from great toâ€¦ unstoppable.
